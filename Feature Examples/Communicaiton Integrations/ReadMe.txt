This folder demonstrates the client/server functionality of BLE using a python program on a laptop to act as the BLE client, and the SwIMU device to act as the server/periphrial. To use these demos, open the .py files in a local python IDE (I prefer spyder in an anaconda environment), and upload the .ino files to the hardware setup. Please complete the first 4 tutorials in the "Hardware Programs" folder to properly configure your device, interface, and SD card module
